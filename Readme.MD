This package helps developers to get rid of manually commenting console.log in files before going to production.

To use this package

`npm install -g console_comment`

`console_comment <directory/> .<extension>`

example:
`console_comment "server/" .js`

Then relax and seat back, Let me handle your cosole.

Happy production :)
